# About project

 For developing this project it was neccessary to use some framework:

* Alamofire: To call Api rest services
* SCLAlertView: To show several alertView to manage errors
* SkeletonView: Needed to show animation until data loades
* Codable : To serialize/deserialize api call responses

- APIServiceManager: HTTP calls to API to get movie information.

- Resources: There are some classes can help us to manage general styles and text resources

- Views : Contains storyboard 

- Modules: Division for app features.
    * ProductCategory: Load and show all categories of Mercado libre
    * Products: Show and load all products by category
    * Favorites: Show a product favorite list (that list is a static data)
    * ProductDetail: Show information about selected product
    
For VIPER ARCHITECTURE, every module has six folder, this way:
    * View: It contains all module views (Cell, UIViewController, Storyboards)
    * Interactor: It constains all business logic of the module
    * Presenter: Class that orchest all the communication between classes
    * Protocols: Interfaz that has all the contract for presenter communication
    * Entity: Api models
    * Router: It let us to navigate between views
